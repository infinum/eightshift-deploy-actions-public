# Eightshift deploy actions - PUBLIC

This repository contains the GitHub actions for deploying Eightshift projects.

## Usage

To use these actions, you need to create a new workflow in your project. You can do that by creating a new YAML (`.yml`) file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

All examples are located in the [private repository](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-deploy-actions-private).
