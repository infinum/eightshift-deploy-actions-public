### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) workflows will run tests on the project, and are triggered on every push to the repository.

- `plugin-project.yml` - runs the tests on plugin projects.
- `plugin.yml` - runs the tests on a single plugin.
- `theme-project.yml` - runs the tests on theme projects.
